## Submission Instructions

Submissions are carried out in 2 steps:
1. Forking the repository (**one time** step!)
2. Pull requests (done each time you want to make a submission)

[**Forking**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) is the action of copying a repository AND keeping it connected to the source (copying but severing the connection is called [**Importing**](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer)).

This allows to create your own copy of the journaling repository. You can make changes to the [**Branch**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) of the copied repository without altering the source. 

Once you are satisfied of your changes, you can then create a [**Pull Request**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in order to submit your weekly journals.
